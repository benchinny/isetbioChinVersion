% Tutorial scripes for isetbio. These are intended to be one our main forms of documentation.
% They illustrate how to do key things in isetbio.
%
% t_adaptiveOptics              - Show how to do some things needed for modeling AO experiments
% t_bipolar                     - Bipolar cell models.
% t_code                        - Illustrate how to code some basic things in Matlab, not directly related biological modeling. 
% t_color                       - Colorimetric calculations.              
% t_cones                       - Calculations for isomerizations, photocurrent, cone mosaics.
% t_data                        - Illustrate data sets.
% t_displays                    - Display modeling. Useful for specifying flat input scenes and modeling experiments.
% t_eyemovement                 - Illustrates generation of eye movement patterns.
% t_human                       - Modeling with human data.
% t_recipes                     - Tutorials that approach real computations, providing useful recipes.
% t_oisequences                 - Temporal sequences of retinal images.
% t_optics                      - Optics related calculatoins.
% t_mosaic                      - Support for describing mosaic geometry. This is DHB code from the early 1990s that we may or may not actually be using.
% t_outersegmemt                - Isomerizations to photocurrent.
% t_rdt                         - Using remote data toolbox.
% t_scene                       - Scene modeling.
% t_wavefront                   - Wavefront optics calculations.
