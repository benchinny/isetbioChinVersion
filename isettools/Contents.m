% Main code tree for isetbio.
%
% bipolar                       - Implmentation of bipolar cells.
% cell                          - Implementation of cellLayer and cellMosaic parent classes. Used by bipolar, rgc, etc.
% codedev                       - For developers. Examples and ideas about how to code things. 
% color                         - Colorimetric support routines.              
% cones                         - Implementation of calculations for isomerizations, photocurrent, cone mosaics.
% data                          - Original isetbio data tree. We are working on organizing this into the data tree one level up.
% deprecate                     - Routines that are obsolete and should be deleted soon.
% displays                      - Implementation of display modeling. Useful for specifying flat input scenes and modeling experiments.
% eyemovement                   - Implementation of eye movement object.
% fonts                         - Support for describing letters.
% gui                           - Support for gui's, used by windows associated with various objects.
% human                         - Mostly routines for returning data about human visual system.  But also has some mouse routines.
% image                         - Support for creating some standard images of interest.
% main                          - Implementation of high level gui interface to some of the calcuations. 
% mosaic                        - Support for describing mosaic geometry. This is DHB code from the early 1990s that we may or may not actually be using.
% opticalimage                  - Implementation of computation of the retinal image.
% rgc                           - Implementation of retinal ganglion cells
% utility                       - A wide range of utility functions, some of which we use.
% wavefront                     - Implementation of wavefront optics calculations
% wrappers                      - Wrapper functions to provide a higher-level API into isetbio
